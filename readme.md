The purpose of this application is to extract file data and metadata for a specified directory. The extracted data will be exported to a Microsoft Excel file.

The metadata is extracted from the file's Alternate Data Streams. 

This program is specifically developed to extract data from a Windows XP environment and may not work on other versions of the operating system.

.NET Framework 4.0 is specifically targeted since it is the latest version compatible with Windows XP.
